I receive a lot of emails of people asking me how to best use the tiles.

The best way to make use of tiles is not by placing individual sprites in the scene, but by building a bigger tilemap with it.

I recommend one of two ways to building tilemaps for your games:

1) Tiled + Tiled2Unity

Tiled ( http://www.mapeditor.org/ ) is probably the best and most user-friendly tilemap editor out there. You can create as many layers as you want and use multiple tilesets per layer.

Tiled2Unity ( http://www.seanba.com/tiled2unity ) is a tool you can use to import your Tiled maps into Unity.

Both tools are free.

It takes a bit to set up the workflow, but once that is done, making tilemaps is a breeze. I've used this technique the most in my own projects.


2) Unity 2017.2 and up

Since 2017.2 Unity comes with its own set of tilemap editing tools. I haven't used them a whole lot but what I have seen so far was impressive.

Here are some videos that showcase the new tools:
