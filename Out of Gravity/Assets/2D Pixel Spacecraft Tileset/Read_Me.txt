INTRODUCTION

Thank you! :-)

This is my first asset and I'm very happy you have chosen my work for your projects! I'm looking forward to any suggestions for improvements and more content, so I can quickly implement them in the next update.

I'm also interested in collaborating with other designers on assets and games.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to shoot me an e-mail.



ANIMATION SHEETS

The following files are meant for creating animations:

* electro barrier
* force door
* keycards
* marine
* shot 1
* shot 2
* sparks
* teleporter savepoint
* window

All sheets consist of multiple 16x16 tiles. 
In most sheets, each row presents a single tile with their intended frames starting on the left side. 
Some sheets give you objects or characters, that are larger that a single 16x16 tile. Here are the measurements for those sheets:

* The Space Marine has a size of 3x3 tiles. The top frames are for a shooting animation, the bottom frames give you the running animation.

* The Teleporter has a size of 2x3 tiles. 

* The Window has a size of 2x2 tiles. It's supposed to be in the background where it simulates the stars passing by.



FUTURE UPDATES

I'm working on the first updates. They will include a playable demo scene and scripts, the corresponding Tiled file and Pyxel Edit files for all sheets.

If you'd like the files before I release the update, shoot me an e-mail and I'll send them to you.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. If you have any questions or need support, you can contact me at: m.stuetzer@gmail.com. 


Thanks for your purchase and have fun with the asset! :-)
